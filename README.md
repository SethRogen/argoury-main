Argoury is a dedicated Runescape private server enthusiast committed to creating the most exceptional game remake possible. This is a big project and for fun, anyone is more than welcome to contribute to this source code. I will do my fair share to try to keep up with updating this. I have currently cleaned up the source files a little bit since the original download and removed some useless stuff that Original Ziotic had there but wasn't complete or needed for my project. I hope to see this grow a public community source and goal is to make this as stable and 1:1 to runescape as p

# Getting Started
* Download cache and extract it to /data/rs2cache/ if rs2cache folder is not there make sure to make it.
* First to start clone the project and open it up into eclipse make sure u are using JRE-1.8 for the project.
* Run "Launcher" Excute the Link Server using this argument: ./data/ -link
* Then we want to start up the game world do the same process by running "Launcher" again and execute this argument: ./data/ -game 1 dual-proto
* Make sure to create an account on the website u will have to join discord to achieve this at the moment.
